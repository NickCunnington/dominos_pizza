# Dominos Pizza Nutritional Information

<br>

### The Project

This project was to practice making a Dashboard using R Shiny and CSS.  It uses nutritional data that was sourced from the Dominos UK website.  The dataset was originally in a PDF format which I convered firstly to .XLSX, then used R to process a variety of data cleaning to get it into a useful state for some analysis.

### How to use the dashboard

The dashboard is hopefully reasonably self explanatory.  The 5 tabs along the top select whether you wish to see information on items the Sides or Pizza Menu.  Here you can select the nutritional macro that you are interested in.  Also there are 2 tabs where you can directly compare 2 different products from each menu in a plot and datatable format.

All of the plots are in % of your recommended daily allowance of each particular macro.  I felt this was a much easier way see nutritional information that didn't involve you using lots of brain power by being shown information in grams and having to work it out yourself!  However for those that are interested I have included the actual macros (in serving size) in a datatable at the bottom of the comparison tabs.
